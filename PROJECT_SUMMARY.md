## 🚀 Next Steps

The project is now ready for development! You can:

1. Start developing your permit management features
2. Add API endpoints for permit operations
3. Implement authentication and authorization
4. Create database models and relationships
5. Add frontend components

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check container status: `make status`
2. View logs: `make logs`
3. Restart services: `make restart`
4. Enter container for debugging: `make shell`
